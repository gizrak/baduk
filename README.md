### Introduction

[Baduk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) is a popular board game that has long been loved in East Asia. Alpha-Go and Lee Se-dol’s games attracted attention from all over the world. At the first time, I tried to make fully web based board game initiatives using HTML5 and Javascript only. Then it worked well.

### Motivation

My father loves this game, but there weren’t many ways to enjoy Baduk online than I decided to develop. So, this app has been implemented to play Baduk with the most accessible web.

### Current

1. Access anywhere from PC or mobile web browser
1. Place both black and white by myself and display the order

### Plans

1. Create user’s own notation(Gibo) and save it
1. Make a game room and play online in real time
1. Chat between users who do not go through the server
